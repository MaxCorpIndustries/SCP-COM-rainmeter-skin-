CTRL R: Reset

The skin is designed to shape around different resolutions (down to 1200x800 if desired).

# Troubleshooting
NOTE: IF YOU SEE THE ERROR: "User name is missing in settings files UserSettings.inc":
Right click SCP C-Com folder, click "open folder" go in "Resources" and edit the file UserSettings.inc with your twitch username and Oauth (www.twitchapps.com/tmi/)

IF YOU DONT HAVE A TWITCH ACCOUNT FILL THE USERNAME WITH A RANDOM NAME AND COPY THE EXAMPLE OAUTH FOR YOUR OAUTH. Note: This will disable the "facility communications access system, as it requires a twitch account to work.

Credit to u/Timsan2 for the twitch chat system! I only modified it to work in the skin. Here's his reddit page on the system:
